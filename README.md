# MYHEALTHGUIDE

“My Nutrition Guide” is a web application that allows users to track their daily food intake and
monitor their nutritional goals. The app utilizes an external API to provide users with real-time information about the nutritional value of the food they consume , and a custom user database API to store and retrieve user data.
I also used the JSON WEB TOKEN to handle user authentication and ensure secure transmission of user data .
